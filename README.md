**Some realizations:**

1. Python is the easiest and fun to learn. The best for prototyping and quickly doing something.
2. For large scale applications: C++ or Java
3. Must learn C/C++ at some point.
4. Learn one OOP language very very well. You can learn other languages in a matter of weeks (if not days)
